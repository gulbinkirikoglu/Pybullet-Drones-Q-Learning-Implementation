# pybullet-drones-q-learning-implementation
 
Description :
It is aimed to learn the position of the drone in the pybullet-drones simulation environment to the desired point in the z axis by using the Q-learning algorithm. In order to ensure that the drone's position on the z axis reaches the point we want, the drone states are learned using 'z position' and 'z speed' data. Drone engines only take down (-1, -1, -1, -1) and up (1, 1, 1, 1) actions.
